Hi! My name is Bethia. I'm a first year Computer Science and Engineering MPhil student at UNSW Sydney, advised by [Yang Song](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~ysong/) and [Maurice Pagnucco](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~morri/). Previously, I completed a dual B.S at the same institution in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

I am driven by the core belief that computational models of intelligence should go <i>beyond</i> optimising arbitrary performance metrics and instead, aim to enhance <i>cognitive plausibility</i>. My research primarily focuses on building <i>cognitively plausible</i> models of intelligence grounded in theoretical formalism and mathematical rigor, and draws inspiration from a wide range of fields, including cognitive science, developmental psychology, and the philosophy of mind. Some keywords are: <span style="color:#5a5a5a; font-family:monospace; font-size:0.75rem;"><i>computational cognitive science, neurocompositional computing, tensor product representations, learning as Bayesian program induction, intrinsic curiosity, empiricism vs nativism, developmental psychology, causality, embodied learning</i></span>. For a more detailed overview of the interests driving my current work and how they fit together, please see the <a href="/interests">interests</a> section. 

Outside of AI research, I enjoy reading books and watching film, indulging my layperson's interest in astronomy/cosmology (a manifestation of my teenage existential angst perhaps...?), snorkelling, and trying to confirm that the Skinnerian resposnse exists in my <a href="/child">feline child</a>. My MBTI is INTP (if you believe in that kind of thing > <) ~

I'm always happy to discuss a variety of random topics, so feel free to <a href="mailto:bethia.sun@unsw.edu.au">reach out</a> if you're interested in having a chat!
